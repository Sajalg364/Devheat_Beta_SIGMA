## Problem Statement-->
It was the year 2020, everything was going well in offline mode, but then came a deadly virus which shifted the college from offline to online mode. The students thought that they would be lucky enough to skip semester exams this time, but the institute had other plans. They wanted the mid semester and end semester exams to happen on schedule.
Since it was not possible to take exams in offline mode, they had to do something to conduct the exams in online mode. There were platforms that could be used to conduct the exam, but they could not be used to conduct the exams because they wanted to keep the exam pattern similar to subjective mode.
You are in the tech team of your institute, and you have been assigned the task to develop an app or a website, which can be used to conduct the semester exams until the students are back in offline mode. 
### Website Name--> Examiner
